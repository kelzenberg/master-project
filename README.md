# Master Project

> [Berliner Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik](https://bht-berlin.de/en) in cooperation with [Fritz-Haber-Institut](https://www.fhi.mpg.de).

---

Everything you need to run and develop this project is described in this README and the READMEs inside the `./packages/**` folders.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start...

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) version `^21.1.x`
  - Including [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) version `^10.2.x`
  - [Optional] [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch Node versions, see `.nvmrc`

### Recommendations

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
  Plus [ESLint Extension](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint/), [Prettier Extension](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [EditorConfig Extension](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig), [DotENV](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=mikestead.dotenv).  
  Preferred VSCodium/VSCode settings:

  ```json
  // Add this to user settings to auto-lint on Save
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
  ],
  ```

## Usage of Project Packages

> This project is **split into several packages**, each of which fulfills a part of the software's intended purpose. They stand on its own as complete software but their content can be imported/used across the whole repository. In doing so this repository becomes a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools).

- You will find each package inside the packages folder within their own subfolder.  
  _Example_ `./packages/frontend`
- Each package has their own README,  
  _Example_ `./packages/frontend/README.md`
- Each package has their own individual configuration files.  
  _Example_ `./packages/frontend/vite.config.js`
- Generic configuration files are located on the root level of the repository and are valid for **all** packages.  
  _Example_ `./eslintrc.json`

### First Step

Compare your local NodeJS version via `node -v` with the required version above.  
Then run `npm install` once to install all dependencies.

**Note:**  
Install NPM dependencies only in their respective workspace.  
For example, `ThreeJS` belongs only to `@master-project/frontend`.

### [@master-project/frontend](https://github.com/kelzenberg/master-project/tree/main/packages/frontend)

**Simulation visualization layer for the web browser**

Usage: `npm run F {dev|build|start|lint|lint:fix|format}`  
Install NPM dependencies: `npm run install:F {dependency-name}`

### [@master-project/backend](https://github.com/kelzenberg/master-project/tree/main/packages/backend)

**Backend server to manage the communication** between simulation and frontend

Usage: `npm run B {dev|build|start|lint|lint:fix|format}`  
Install NPM dependencies: `npm run install:B {dependency-name}`

### [@master-project/libs](https://github.com/kelzenberg/master-project/tree/main/packages/libs)

**Shared modules and data**

Usage: `npm run L {build|lint|lint:fix|format}`  
Install NPM dependencies: `npm run install:L {dependency-name}`

### Global Scripts

You can run any common NPM command _for all packages_ by adding a `--workspaces` to it.

- Lint source files in all packages

  ```sh
  npm run --workspaces lint
  # to fix errors directly:
  npm run --workspaces lint:fix
  ```

- Format source files in all packages
  ```sh
  npm run --workspaces format
  ```
