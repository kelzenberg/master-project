Simulation visualization layer for the web browser

---

## First step

Check the [global README](https://github.com/kelzenberg/master-project/blob/main/README.md) for requirements and usage.

## Usage

- Start development server in watch mode _(on [http://localhost:3080](http://localhost:3080))_  
  <small>This only serves the HTML files but does not connect via the WebSockets to load essential simulation data.</small>

  ```sh
  npm run F dev
  ```

- Build app (for production)

  ```sh
  npm run F build
  ```
